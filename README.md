# WaveTable

![Preview](docs/preview.png)

[WaveTable](https://wavetable.vercel.app/) is a web-based synthesizer heavily inspired by [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/).

> ðŸš§ The synth is still below version `1.0.0`, so the design and features are subject to change quickly


## Design

Check out [the design](https://www.figma.com/design/SUOfDkDqhKT0DEqqgZxkDa/Wavetable?node-id=14-36&t=MqeZoXHTa5FT3Vim-1) in Figma. As the design requirements change, the project will be soon to follow. If you'd like to add a new feature and want to design it yourself, fork the design on figma and add it on your issue or pull request!
